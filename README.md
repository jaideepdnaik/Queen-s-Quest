# Queen-s-Quest
The ”Queen’s Quest” project is a captivating implementation of the N-Queens problem using OpenGL and FreeGLUT. The aim of this project is to provide users with an interactive and engaging experience, allowing them to select different levels of difficulty and solve the N-Queens puzzle on a dynamically sized chessboard.
The application presents users with a visually appealing interface where they can place and remove queens on the chessboard using intuitive controls. The size of the chessboard varies according to the selected level, offering users a range of challenges to overcome. To enhance the user experience, the project also includes a feature that provides a solution to the N-Queens problem. Users can access this feature by pressing a designated key, which will display a valid solution for the current board configuration.
